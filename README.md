Right now the game board is rendered using 1's to signify cells that are alive,
and 0's to signify cells that are dead. Your job is to change this app to
display black squares for cells that are alive, and white squares for cells that
are dead.

You can do this any way that you choose, but there is a provided Component
called `Cell` to act as a framework for your solution.  Feel free to change or
not change any of the following files:

- App.js
- App.css
- Cell.js

You can also add any additional files or components you think would be helpful!

Your pair is here to help, and you have full access to google as well, have fun!
